# CID Router

<hr/>
Content address everything.
<hr/>

`cid-router` resolves requests for [CIDs](TODO) into [routes](TODO) for retrieval of the content and/or resources related to the content.

`cid-router` is not opinionated about types of CIDs, routes, or underlying protocols used by routes.

`cid-router` can be configured to consume routes from any number of CRPs (CID Route Provider).
