# CID Router

<hr/>
Content address everything.
<hr/>

`cid-router` resolves requests for [CIDs](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/#what-is-a-cid) into [routes](/crates/routes) for retrieval of the content and/or resources related to the content.

`cid-router` is not opinionated about types of CIDs, routes, or underlying protocols used by routes.

`cid-router` can be configured to consume routes from any number of CRPs (CID Route Provider).

# Quick Start

Nix is used for managing development environments and build artifacts.

Enter development shell with all required tools:

```shell
nix develop
```

# Makefile

There is a Makefile to make the nix-managed builds and docker exports simpler to manage. Build artifacts are placed in `_build/`

Build `cid-router` binary:

```shell
make bin.cid-router
```

Build `cid-router` docker image:

```shell
make image.cid-router`
```

Build all docker images:

```shell
make image.all
```

Build all artifacts:

```shell
make all
```
